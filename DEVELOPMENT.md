# `pseusys` personal repository

## README file (and GitHub profile)

The original `README.md` file is on `source` branch, each day + on every change it gets rebuilt.
After rebuilding, it is pushed to `main` branch (that is visible on [pseusys GitHub profile](https://github.com/pseusys)).
The `README` is accompanied with all built images in a single commit.

## Curriculum vitae

2. Projects: replace name + link with name (MD link) + GitHub link.
