      place: Ansys - Lyon, France
      resp: |
        + Was part of a team responsible for data storage and transfer optimization between different parts of [AnsysDPF](https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com) infrastructure.
        + Proposed and implemented in Python code generation design; internal data structures have been wrapped with consistent and schema-based generated user interfaces (in Python, C++ and C#).
        + As a result, codebase maintenance needs were reduced, codestyle and documentation coverage increased and further development sped up significantly.

      place: Amadeus - Nice, France
      resp: |
        + Worked in-between of teams responsible for Amadeus ticket search engine testing and development.
        + Developed a mutation testing framework in Python, that was adding minor changes to the C++ source code and then checking if those changes are caught by existing test suite.
        + Periodical running of the framework helped improving test coverage and reducing number of human-factor bugs, like typos and misspellings (still, it takes considerable amount of time).

    - job: Robotics Intern
      place: Grenoble Computer Science Laboratory - LIGLAB
      resp: |
        + Explored possibility of replacing algorithm-based navigation mechanism used in laboratory robots equipped with 2D LiDARs with machine-learning based one.
        + Has developed C++ and Python interfaces for RobotOS, allowing different navigation algorithm integration, compared them both physically and in simulation.
        + Even though trained neural networks didn't outperform existing algorithms (primarily due to annotation issues in LIDAR records used for training), still the developed interfaces are used in further researches.
