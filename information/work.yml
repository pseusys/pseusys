    - job: Research and Development Engineer
      place: Synopsys - Lyon, France
      resp: |
        + Changed the physical simulation data representation and its' API, focusing on processing and transmission speed.
        + Enhanced user library by providing copy-less and allocation-less access to raw FlatBuffers-based data using generated code in C++, Python and C\#.
        + User interface became more friendly, efficient and more consistent with the well-defined schemas, used as the source of truth.

    - job: Backend Developing Intern
      place: Ansys - Lyon, France
      resp: |
        + Was part of a team responsible for data storage and transfer optimization between different parts of [AnsysDPF](https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com) infrastructure.
        + Proposed and implemented in Python a code generation design; internal data structures have been wrapped with consistent and schema-based generated user interfaces (in Python, C++ and C\#).
        + As a result, codebase maintenance needs were reduced, code style and documentation coverage increased, and further development sped up significantly.

    - job: Full Stack Intern
      place: Amadeus - Nice, France
      resp: |
        + Worked between teams responsible for Amadeus ticket search engine testing and development.
        + Developed a mutation testing framework in Python, which added minor changes to the C++ source code and then checked if those changes were caught by the existing test suite.
        + Periodically running the framework helped improve test coverage and reduce the number of human-factor bugs, like typos and misspellings (still, it takes a considerable amount of time).

    - job: Robotics Intern
      place: Grenoble Computer Science Laboratory - LIGLAB
      resp: |
        + Explored the possibility of replacing the algorithm-based navigation mechanism used in laboratory robots equipped with 2D LiDARs with a machine-learning-based one.
        + Developed C++ and Python interfaces for RobotOS, allowing different navigation algorithms to be integrated, and compared them both physically and in simulation.
        + Even though trained neural networks didn't outperform existing algorithms (primarily due to annotation issues in LiDAR records used for training), the developed interfaces are still used in further research.

    - job: Software Engineer
      place: DeepPavlov.ai - Remote, Part-Time
      resp: |
        + Took part in [chatsky](https://github.com/deeppavlov/chatsky) dialog bot creation framework development.
        + Was responsible for both basic framework functionality implementation (in Python), asynchronous database integrations (Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL), and static documentation website generation (using Sphinx, JavaScript, and CSS).
        + Was involved in creating multiple user interfaces (CLI, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Discord bindings) and worked on CI/CD pipeline enhancement in GitHub Actions.
        + All of that expanded the framework core use cases, improved performance, increased test coverage, made documentation easily available, and contributed to both better developer and user experience.
