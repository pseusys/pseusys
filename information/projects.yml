  - name: SeasideVPN
    tools: Python, Go, Rust, Docker
    desc: |
      + Traditionally, VPN protocols are more focused on hiding the transmitted data but not the fact that a VPN is used; a few existing solutions a very complex and still leak information through side channels.
      + This project is a VPN system, designed specifically to address this issue: it has a simple design and uses as-secure-as-possible communication protocols.
      + An example client and testing system is implemented in Python (relying heavily on Docker), VPN server is implemented in Go, a faster and safer client is implemented in Rust.

  - name: HogweedGo
    tools: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Docker, TensorFlow, Dart, Flutter
    desc: |
      + Due to rapid climate changing, many plant species, originally native to warmer environments, are spreading further to the north; which can be dangerous to local habitats as well as unaware humans.
      + HogweedGo is a monitoring system, that allows volunteers to mark spotted alien plants on the map, attach their pictures and descriptions; after that, an expert team can process their findings and act appropriately.
      + System uses client-server architecture, with client written in Dart (using Flutter framework) and equipped with a neural network trained for plant species detection; server is written in Python (using Django framework).

  - name: create-logger
    tools: Typescript, Pug, Less
    desc: |
      + It is very important sometimes to improve user experience of CLI-based programs by highlighting console output with different colors and styles; still, appropriate libraries do not exist for every platform and language.
      + This project is a WYSIWYG text editor for terminal logs, capable of producing text formatted with [ANSI escape characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) as well as sample code implementation for enabling and printing it.
      + It is a static website written from scratch (with no dependencies), using Typescript, Babel, Webpack, Pug, Less and Mocha; it is built by GitHub Actions and hosted on GitHub Pages.

  - name: Silentium Morse Messenger
    tools: Kotlin, Android Framework
    desc: |
      + This project focuses on exploring different ways of user communication with their mobile devices, other than reading text from screen and typing text with keyboard.
      + It consists of a messenger, that uses Morse code for information transfer; messages be sent by pressing one big button (a special keyboard layout is included) and received as text, vibrations, sound or flashlight.
      + The messenger is written in Kotlin for Android platform, using Firebase Functions and Firebase Storage.

  - name: MushOS
    tools: NASM, C, Makefile, CMake
    desc: |
      + Most of the modern operating systems have been designed long time ago and use common conventions for interoperability and portability; this project explores what could be done differently in OS design and what consequences it would have.
      + The project consists of an 32-bit OS, written from scratch starting from the bootloader and assembly code; it uses NASM for assembly code, C for kernel, Makefile and CMake for building and running, also relying on CTest and Doxygen.
